<BR>

Gloo is a function gateway built on top of the [Envoy Proxy](https://www.Envoyproxy.io). Gloo provides a unified entry point
for access to all services and serverless functions, translating from any interface spoken by a client to any interface
spoken by a backend. Gloo aggregates REST APIs and events calls from clients, "glueing" together services in-cluster, 
out of cluster, across clusters, along with any provider of serverless functions.

This Repo 
----

This repository contains the sources for the Gloo Secret Client. 

Developers of integrations should use this repository as a client library for their application (if it's written in Go).
Support for more languages is in our roadmap.  

For information about storage in Gloo and writing client integrations, see our [documentation](https://gloo.solo.io).
